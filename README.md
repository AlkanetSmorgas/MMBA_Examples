# MMBA_Examples
Example Missions for MMBA, Arma 3.

### Installing

To download the mission, click on the green button "Clone or download". Download Zip.

The arma 3 eden editor missions are located under "Documents\Arma 3\missions".

Open the zip file and drag the folder you want to "Documents\Arma 3\missions". 

```
Example: Drag the folder MMBA_AirportInvasion.Altis to missions folder.
```
In the end it should look like this:
```
Documents\Arma 3\missions\MMBA_AirportInvasion.Altis
```

Now you just need to open Eden editor in arma 3, in the toolbar at the top, select Scenario, then open.
Make sure the missions folder is selected, then choose the MMBA_AirportInvasion.

## Learning

I recomend you to use the MMBA_AirportInvasion.Altis mission first. Look how the modules are connected and their attributes. You can also use the ingame tutorial to get more information. (You can find the tutorial in the eden editor, in the toolbar at the top, under "Help" or "MMBA".
